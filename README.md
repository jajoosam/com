Twitter's own retweet bot
> https://com.glitch.me

COM is a twitter retweet bot powered by the community. It retweets according to the filters you set up for it.

Twitter search filters are used to match filters, and `public/index.html` includes a GUI for building these filters. This GUI then opens a modal with the twitter intent of adding a filter.

Uptime Robot ensures that the bot runs every minute.

Remix the bot, run your own version quicly through Glitch.
